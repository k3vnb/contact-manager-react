# Contact Manager

## This app is based on Brad Traversy's course "React Front to Back" on Udemy.com. It is a CRUD app, utilizing create-react-app, bootstrap, the 'context' API instead of Redux, with Axios calls to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ for mock data.

### Users can add, edit, and delete contacts. The changes are not persisted to a database, but they are made to the DOM.
